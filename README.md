## about me:

### FE simulations:

* over twenty years of experience with [Finite Element Methods (FEM) for structural, thermal, electromagnetic and fluids analyses for MEMS applications](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/FEM_benchmarks);
* numerical methods referred as Reduced Order Modeling ([ROM](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/ROM_benchmarks));
* ANSA, [ANSYS Multiphysics](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/APDL_scripts), ANSYS Maxwell, ANSYS HFSS, ANSYS CFX, and ANSYS LS-DYNA;

### MEMS design:

* experience with inertial MEMS sensors design like AE sensors, gyroscope, accelerometer, and pressure sensors;
* dimensional design, layouting, simulation and optimization, characterization;

### RF design:

* BAW filters design for mobile applications (LTE-A); 
* simulation of complex LPAMiD RF Front-End Modules (containing PAs, LNAs, Switches and Switchplexers) using ADS, AWR, HFSS;

### Circuit and system design:

* PSPICE, Simulink, VHDL-AMS (hAMSter, ANSYS/ANSOFT Simplorer; SystemVision/PartQuest)

### Algorithms/Methods and Code development:

* development of simulation methods for [nonlinear piezoresistance in p-type silicon](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/piezoresistance_in_p-type_silicon);
* anisotropic conductivity implementation in FEM for strain gauge optimization;
* [multivariate rational fit](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/LMGT_code/tree/master/RatFit6); 
* parameterized sub-structuring technique; 
* [parameterization using FEM](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/LMGT_code/tree/master/HODparametricFEM) and [mesh morphing](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/FEM_benchmarks/tree/main/parametric_mesh_morphing); 
* parameterized mode superposition-based technique;
* development the [library of MEMS/NEMS components in VHDL-AMS](https://github.com/Kolchuzhin/LMGT_MEMS_component_library);
* integration of the MEMS/NEMS models at the system level;

## Undergraduate and Graduate courses:
